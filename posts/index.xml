            <description>After a few hours of tinkering with Jekyll for my blog, I&#39;ve finally made the jump to HUGO. Setup is easy and straightforward, It took me more time in deciding which theme to use and which host to deploy my site than the setup itself.
Installation Since I&#39;m on Arch Linux, installation is as easy as:

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a few hours of tinkering with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for my blog, I've finally made the jump to <a href="http://gohugo.io">HUGO</a>. Setup is easy and straightforward, It took me more time in deciding which theme to use and which host to deploy my site than the setup itself.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Since I'm on Arch Linux, installation is as easy as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ sudo pacman -S hugo
</code></pre></div><h3 id="creating-a-site">Creating a site</h3>
<p>Now that HUGO is installed, create a new site by running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ hugo new site clickdot
</code></pre></div><p>This command creates all the files necessary to run a fully functional website.</p>
<h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
<p>The next step will be to download a theme or create your own. Totally up to you. You can check out the themes at <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io/">themes.gohugo.io</a></p>
<p>Themes can be installed via git or by downloading the archive straight from the author's repo and unpacking it under the <strong>themes</strong> folder if you don't have git in your system. For git users, you can run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ git submodule add URL_OF_THE_THEME.git themes/themename
</code></pre></div><p>This command will download a copy of the theme to your <strong>themes</strong> folder. Follow your chosen theme's configuration instructions. Some of them only requires you to edit the config file in the root folder of your site.</p>
<h3 id="creating-your-first-post">Creating your first post</h3>
<p>To create a draft post simply follow the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ hugo new posts/hello-world.md
</code></pre></div><p>You will now have a new file under your <strong>contents</strong> folder (where all your posts will be saved) named <strong>hello-world.md</strong>. You can edit this file using a text editor of your choice. I'm using gedit.</p>
<p>All your posts in <a href="http://gohugo.io">HUGO</a> will be on the Markdown language. A list of the basic syntax can be found at <a href="http://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">markdownguide.org/basic-syntax</a></p>
<h3 id="running-hugo">Running HUGO</h3>
<p>It's time to get that site up and running in your <em>local</em> system</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ hugo server -D
</code></pre></div><p>Once it's up and running, head over to <a href="http://localhost:1313/.">http://localhost:1313</a> on your browser.</p>
<h3 id="now-the-fun-part-begins">Now the fun part begins</h3>
<p>Feel free to edit the config, theme and posts as you like.</p>
<h3 id="creating-static">Creating static</h3>
<p>Time to un-draft those posts since drafts don't get deployed. Just replace <em>draft: true</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">---
title: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello hugo&#34;</span>
date: 2019-12-28T17:59:52+08:00
draft: true
---
</code></pre></div><p>with <em>draft: false</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">---
title: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello hugo&#34;</span>
date: 2019-12-28T17:59:52+08:00
draft: false
---
</code></pre></div><p>To build the static pages, just run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ hugo -D
</code></pre></div><p>This will create a folder named public containing all the necessary files for deployment.</p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>You are free to choose which host to deploy your site. I recommend <a href="http://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> since it's free. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> is also a good choice if you are willing to go through additional steps with the setup. I might do a guide on how to deploy in github soon.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>All commands are working at the time of writing. I am by no means responsible for any damages caused to your system, although the commands listed are pretty much straightforward and generally harmless.</p>
